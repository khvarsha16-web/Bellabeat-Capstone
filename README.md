## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

1. **Momentum-Based Progress Design**: Visualize trends over weeks instead of daily streaks.
2. **Passive Engagement for Non-Screen Devices**: Weekly summaries instead of real-time alerts.
3. **Emotionally Intelligent Re-engagement**: Send “start fresh” messages instead of guilt-driven nudges.

These insights aim to improve app retention, user wellness, and long-term brand loyalty.
